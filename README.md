# DSP-pROJECT-HEALTH-CARE
# This project implements a secure MySQL database for managing healthcare data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and role-based access control. 
# Sensitive fields like gender and age are encrypted using Fernet, while password security is ensured with SHA-256 hashing. Role-based access dynamically filters queries, granting Group H full access and restricting Group R to non-sensitive data. 
# The system is set up using the generate_db.py script, which automates table creation, encryption, and data population.
